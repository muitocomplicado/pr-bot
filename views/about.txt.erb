I'm a PR bot. I have the following commands available:
- !latest returns the latest posts in the forums.
- !server <shortname> gets the current server status.
- !server <shortname> <ip>:<port> registers the server with that shortname.
- !released <version_number> checks if a version was released. 
- !hardcoded [something] [true|false] gets or sets if that thing is hardcoded.
- !country <nick> [country] gets or sets the country of that person.
